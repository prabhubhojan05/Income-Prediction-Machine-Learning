# Income Prediction Model

## Determining Income Brackets with Machine Learning

### Overview

The primary objective of this project was to construct a prediction methodology for determining the income bracket of individuals. To achieve this, I developed a predictive model using various ML algorithms, incorporating exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, data cleaning, feature engineering, and feature selection. This comprehensive approach resulted in an impressive 83% accuracy, showcasing the model's capability to effectively predict income levels.
